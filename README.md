## Web tool for the iterative verification of camera trap classifications

**CamTrap Verify** is an open-source web application designed to help ecologists and wildlife researchers review and validate species detections produced by AI classifiers or citizen-science platforms. It consumes any directory in [CamtrapDP v1.0](https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org/) format and guides the expert through a structured, iterative review workflow that minimises the total number of images that need to be inspected.

In each round, the tool presents the **highest-confidence sequence** not yet reviewed for every combination of site × sampling period × species. Confirming a sequence closes that cell; rejecting it queues the next-best sequence for the following round. This ensures that expert effort is always directed where it matters most — without having to look at every single image.

Once the review is complete, **CamTrap Verify** exports a verified CamtrapDP package with confirmed observations tagged as human classifications, together with detection histories and camera-operation matrices ready to feed directly into species occupancy models.

## ✨ Features

**Data ingestion**
- Accepts any [CamtrapDP v1.0](https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org/) directory directly
- Built-in converter for [DeepFaune](https://www.deepfaune.cnrs.fr/) CSV exports
- Generic CSV importer with configurable column mapping and interactive species-name editor for any AI classifier output

**Review workflow**
- Iterative review by rounds: for each site × sampling-period × species cell, the highest-confidence detection sequence is always shown first
- Confirming a sequence closes the cell; rejecting it queues the next-best sequence in the following round, minimising total expert effort
- Optional burst-context mode: shows all frames of the physical burst (not only those labelled as the target species) so the expert can see the animal entering and leaving
- Optional extended confirmation: marks all observations in the confirmed burst — not just the highest-confidence frame — as human-verified in the output

**Image viewer**
- Interactive carousel with zoom, pan, rotation, tonal inversion and full keyboard navigation
- Brightness and contrast controls
- Full-screen lightbox

**Output**
- Exports `camtrap_dp_verified/` with confirmed observations tagged as human classifications; configurable `classifiedBy` label
- Generates naive vs. verified detection histories and camera-operation matrices ready for occupancy models (`occupancy_inputs/`)

**General**
- Bilingual interface (Spanish / English)
- Docker deployment or hot-reload development mode
